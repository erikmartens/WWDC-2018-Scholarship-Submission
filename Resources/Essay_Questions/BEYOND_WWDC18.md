About two years ago I began learning Swift and wrote my first iOS app that is still being maintained today. In August 2016 "DayCalc Calendar" got accepted into the App Store. I wrote a blog post about my journey, which was a lucky decision as I got noticed by a local startup. They offered me a student-job and since then I am a part of their iOS team. 

I am incredibly thankful for their mentoring and the resources they have pointed me to. Both really steepened my learning curve. Without them, I would be much less experienced today. While developing my first app I got started using tutorials from other developers' blog posts and the Ray Wenderlich tutoring team. I did not know platforms like Github or the open-source iOS community existed. There is some incredible stuff out there (e.g. the open-source Kickstarter iOS app heavily inspired me) and one day I would love to be able to author similar projects. It would be such a great experience to meet the people behind those projects and libraries at WWDC. I still have a long journey ahead of me, but I already enjoy sharing and giving back. I still remember how I got started and I would like to provide what would have been helpful to me.

An example is the small weather app named "NearbyWeather" that I had to write as part of my student-job application. I have been augmenting it steadily based on the new skills I learned. It is available on my GitHub account free with an MIT license. Contributions are welcome. It is rather simple, but hopefully, it can help those just starting out. Throughout the past months, I also started engaging more with the open-source community. I recently had the app listed in an open-source app directory on GitHub. Once the WWDC18 scholarship judging process has been completed, my submission will also be open sourced. I would be happy if it made a difference for next year's aspiring scholars, just as I was able to learn from the material past winners have shared openly. 

A major issue that has kept me thinking for many years though is the lack of focus on consumer tech in Germany. For my company, it is incredibly tough to find iOS engineers, while there seems to be no shortage of applicants for backend development positions. There is no course for iOS development at my university. My co-workers told me the same about their universities. Most students seem not to be interested in mobile development at all, while I think it is the future of consumer computing. Maybe that interest is lurking but was never unlocked because in a typical public school computer science courses mainly include database technologies. I would really enjoy teaching an iOS development course as a guest lecturer one day. Maybe I would have found my true passion earlier if there was such an offering when I was younger.
