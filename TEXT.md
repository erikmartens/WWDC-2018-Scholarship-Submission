Since I began developing iOS Applications about 2 years ago, I've always wanted to create not just productivity based apps, but simple games as well.

With this year's submission I finally took the dive and started teaching myself SpriteKit. My reasoning was that this technology could create an enjoyable playground experience and at same time would allow me to get started working with frameworks I hadn't touched yet. I am very passionate about open source efforts and love sharing my knowledge. Becoming a developer happened rather late during my life. Often I can't help but wonder whether I would have gotten in earlier, if there was a learning offering that would have taken away what seemed to be an unclimbable mountain to me. This has made me very focused on trying to provide back to the community.

Typically I use a mix of UIKit, MapKit, CoreLocation
