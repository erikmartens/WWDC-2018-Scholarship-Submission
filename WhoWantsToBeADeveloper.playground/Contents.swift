 # Welcome to "Who Wants to Be a Developer"
 
 In this playground you will learn about the programming language [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/),
 by answering questions based on a variation of the popular _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire_ game format. Whether you are a beginner, intermediary or expert, there is a game mode for you.
 
 My personal journey has taught me that anyone can achieve their goals, when they are taught in a fashion that suits their personal needs.
 With this playful approach to learning Swift anyone who enjoys diving into a new topic via a quiz like fashion will feel right at home.
 
 > To get started open the live view inside the assistant editor. You can also add your own questions to get a more personalized learning experience.
 
 __Enjoy!__ ❤️
