 # Welcome to "Who Wants to Be a Developer"
 
 Dear Player, welcome to this Xcode Playground ðŸ¤—
 
You will be learning about object-oriented sowtware development with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/),
 by playing a variation of the popular _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire_ game format. Since I am personally an iOS centered developer, this Playground was built with focus on that platform, both regarding the questions you will find and the underlying code itself.
 
 My personal journey has taught me that anyone can achieve their goals, when their urge to find out more and being involved is tickled. Breaking the ice is essential. Beginning easy but challenging and then increasing the difficulty gradually will trigger the thirst for more, instead of creating frustration. This Playground aims at emulating such an experience. If you have 3 minutes everyday to play and to answer some questions, you will solidify your knowledge and be inspired to dig deeper. Once you're ready, dive into the underlying code of the Playground and modify it to your liking.
 
 However in the this Playground is not limited to programming, but to your interests only. Due to its modularity, substituting your own set of questions is trivial. Pursue the instructions below to find out more.
 
 - IMPORTANT:
In order to use the "_Resume Game_" and "_Highscores_" features you need to create a directory with the name `Shared Playground Data` inside `~/Documents`. This directory needs to be created manually, Playgrounds cannot assist you due to [sandboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)). Or you execute the following 2 commands within a new _Terminal_ session:

- `cd ./Documents`
- `mkdir Shared\ Playground\ Data`
 
> __USING YOUR NAME:__
 If you want to use your own name for highscore entries, you can modify the `PlayerName.txt` file, which is located inside the package contents of this playground at `WhotWantsToBeADeveloper/Resources/Data/PlayerName.txt`
 
 > __ADDING YOUR OWN QUESTIONS:__ You can also add your own questions by hacking the `Questions.json` file. The use of this human readable format enables you to create your personalized flashcard based learning experience. __*Pro Tip*__: Keep different files handy, so you can interchange them to study for all of your subjects.
 
 __Enjoy and hopefully see you at WWDC 18__ ðŸ’œ
