## About the Playground
_"Who Wants to Be a Developer"_ is a fun playground, focused on learning. In this WWDC18 Scholarship Submission, you will be learning about any topic you choose by playing a variation of the popular _"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"_ game format. The game style has been adapted to an arcade experience. Answer as many questions to set a new highscore. Every 10 rounds you will be equipped with the fifty-fifty-joker. The game comes bundled with questions about the programming language [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/), but thanks to its modularity you can easily swap them out with your own. Simply create a new JSON file.
